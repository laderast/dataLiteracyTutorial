## Learning Objectives

+ Understand how we can represent different kinds of data
+ Understand how to communicate with visualizations
+ Understand when visualizations are misleading

Graph literacy
https://concord.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pdf/teaching-graph-literacy-across-curriculum.pdf

### Why Visualization?

Visualization is good for exploring data because we are really good at evaluating data visually.

+ We need to become aware of patterns in the data.
+ Sometimes these patterns are desirable:
    + Associations

### Undesirable Variation

+ Sometimes they are not desirable:
    + Experimental Artefacts

### Outline

+ Base Visualizations
+ Aesthetics
+ Activity

![http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html](images/choosing_a_good_chart.jpg)

### What a graph needs

+ Title (what it represents)
+ Labeled Axes (with units, preferably)
+ Variables and how they are represented
+ Scales
    + Is it a count or is it a proportion?
- How many variables and their types
    - Including ones used to dictate colors, shapes, patterns, sizes, opacities, etc.
    - Independent ("*predictor*") variables (e.g. time) are usually on the X (horizontal) axis
        - Occasionally time is plotted on the vertical axis for specific reasons
    - Dependent ("*outcome*" / "*response*") variables are usually on the Y (vertical) axis

```{r echo=FALSE}
NHANES %>% ggplot(aes(x=Weight,y=BMI)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm",se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Weight vs. BMI in NHANES study") 
```

## The Data (NHANES)

We're going to look at data from a study called [NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Survey)](). 

### What does the data actually look like?

Here are the first 10 rows of the data table. Each row of the data corresponds to a patient. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes[1:10,]
```

```{r datatable, echo=FALSE}
question("How many patients have High BMI (BMIstatus = `High`) and are Male (Gender = `Male`) from these first 10 rows?",
  answer("There are 3 patients.", correct=TRUE, message="Correct. There are 3 patients who have high BMI and are male."),
    answer("There are 4 patients.", message="Not quite. Go back and count."),
  answer("There are 5 patients.", message="Not quite. Go back and count."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Summary Data

Let's take a look at a summary of the data. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

summary(bmi_diabetes)
```

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}
question("What can we learn from this summary table?",
  answer("The smallest BMI value is 15.", correct=TRUE, message="Correct!"),
  answer("There are two variables", message="Not quite. There's `outcome`, `smoker`, and `age`."),
  answer("You are considered as having diabetes versus not having diabetes", correct=TRUE, message="Yes, that's correct!"),
  answer("The age range of the patients includes minors.", message="Incorrect. Look at the min value for age."),
  answer("The average age of the participant was around 47 years of age", correct="Yes, the mean age was 46.92 years of age. Yes, you can see it as the mean value for the age" ),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Categorical Data

Categorical data has a limited number of values. Some examples include: your home state, ethnicity, what kind of phone you have (iOS/Android).

### Let's look at Diabetes in our patients

One tool we often use to explore the data is a `table`, which counts how much of each category is there. Which group is larger?

```{r echo = TRUE}
table(bmi_diabetes$Diabetes)
```

Here's another way to look at the data, a bar plot. You can instantly see which of the groups is larger.

```{r echo=TRUE}
bmi_diabetes %>% tidyr::drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=Diabetes)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Summary of Patients: Diabetes")
```

Sometimes it is easier to look at a table, but usually a bar chart will make things more obvious.

### Stacked Barplots

We can also stack values on top of each other to make a stacked barplot. This can be useful when comparing categories.

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes %>% tidyr::drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(1), fill=Diabetes)) + geom_bar(width=1, position = "stack", color="black") +  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

### Look at the scale

What does the y-axis represent in each of these graphs?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7}
plot1 <- bmi_diabetes %>% tidyr::drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(1), fill=Diabetes)) + geom_bar(width=1, position = "stack", color="black") +  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank()) + ggtitle("Counts of Diabetes Patients")

plot2 <- bmi_diabetes %>% tidyr::drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(1), fill=Diabetes)) + geom_bar(width=1, position = "fill", color="black") +  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank()) + ggtitle("Proportions of Diabetes Patients")

cowplot::plot_grid(plot1, plot2)
```

### Stacked Barplots vs Pie Charts

Pie charts are ok for variables that just have two or three categories, but they become difficult to compare across two pie charts. 

Take a look at the barchart and pie chart. Which group (`male` or `female`) has the larger proportion of Diabetes patients? (Note that the scale has changed!)

```{r echo=FALSE}
outPlot <- bmi_diabetes %>% tidyr::drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(1), fill=Diabetes)) + geom_bar(position="fill",width=1, color="black") + facet_grid(".~Gender") + 
  
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank())

outPlot + ggtitle("Stacked Bar Plot comparing Diabetes by Gender")

outPlot2 <- outPlot + coord_polar("y", start=0) + theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  )

outPlot2 + ggtitle("Pie Charts comparing Diabetes by Gender")
```

## Continuous Data

### Histograms

A [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) shows the distribution of a continuous variable by splitting it into bins and counting how many observations fall into each bin (left). 

You can think of a histogram as a bar graph where the x variable is numeric. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(3)
data("bmi_diabetes",package = "dataLiteracyTutorial")

bmi_diabetes_small <- bmi_diabetes %>% dplyr::sample_n(size=200)

bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=BMI)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill="white", color="black") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of Patients of\nNHANES with BMI Values")
```

[Definition edited from Mikhail Popov](https://github.com/bearloga/wmf-allhands18)

### Histogram: Play with the Bins

To make a histogram, we have to bin the data, or convert the continuous data into ranges. 

Try adjusting the number of bins for the histogram. What details gets lost as you adjust the number of bins downwards?

```{r echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("hist_slider", "Number of Bins", min = 2, max=40, value = 15)
plotOutput("hist_plot")
```

```{r context="server"}
data("bmi_diabetes",package = "dataLiteracyTutorial")
set.seed(3)

bmi_diabetes_small <- bmi_diabetes %>% dplyr::sample_n(size=200)

output$hist_plot <- renderPlot(
  bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=BMI)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = input$hist_slider, 
                   fill="white", color="black") + xlim(c(10, 85))
)
```

### All the different ways to represent a continuous variable

Try out all the different ways you can represent a continuous variable in a distribution. Which one do you like?

```{r echo=FALSE}
selectInput("hist3_scale", label = "Select type of scale",choices = c("histogram", "density","boxplot", "violin", "dotplot", "box+violin"), selected="histogram")
plotOutput("cont1_plot")
```

```{r context="server"}
#load(here("data", "bmi_diabetes.rda"))

output$cont1_plot <- renderPlot({
outPlot <- bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=BMI)) 

bins <- 30

  if(input$hist3_scale =="histogram"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_histogram(bins = bins, 
                                      fill="white", color="black")}
  if(input$hist3_scale == "density"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_density()
  }

  if(input$hist3_scale == "boxplot"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_boxplot(aes(y=BMI)) + coord_flip()
  }

  if(input$hist3_scale == "violin"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_violin(aes(y=BMI)) + coord_flip()
  }

  if(input$hist3_scale == "dotplot"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_dotplot(bins=bins, size=1)
  }

  if(input$hist3_scale == "box+violin"){
    outPlot <- outPlot  + geom_boxplot(aes(y=BMI), width=0.5) + 
      geom_violin(aes(y=BMI), adjust=0.5) + coord_flip()
  }

  outPlot <- outPlot + xlim(c(10, 85))
  
  outPlot
})
```

### Something weird about age

Let's look at our other continuous covariate, `Age`. Does the dotplot show anything weird to you?

```{r}
bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=Age)) + geom_dotplot(size=1) + xlim(c(21, 90)) 
```

## Relationships: 2 categorical variables

Now we're going to delve into ways of visualizing the relationships between two categorical variables.

### Association

```{r echo = FALSE}
data("bmi_diabetes",package = "dataLiteracyTutorial")
set.seed(3)
bmi_diabetes_small <- bmi_diabetes %>% dplyr::sample_n(size=200)

bmi_diabetes_small %>% select(BMIstatus, Diabetes) %>% table()
```

### Proportional versus Frequency

Change the barplot type from `regular` to `proportional`. What changes? (look at the scale before/after).

Which barplot type helps you answer the question: "Is there a larger proportion of people with Diabetes with High BMI compared to those who have a low BMI?"

Which barplot helps you understand how many people had Diabetes with low BMI?

```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput("bar_control1", "Select type of Barplot", choices=c("proportional", "regular"), selected="regular")
plotOutput("bar_1")
```

```{r context="server"}
output$bar_1 <- renderPlot({
  
  outPlot <- bmi_diabetes_small %>% filter(!is.na(BMIstatus)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=BMIstatus, fill=Diabetes))
  
  if(input$bar_control1 == "regular"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_bar(position="stack", color="black")
  }
  
  if(input$bar_control1 == "proportional"){
    outPlot <- outPlot + geom_bar(position="fill", color="black")
  }
  
  outPlot
})

```

### Quiz Yourself

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes_small %>% filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Gender, fill=Diabetes)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill", color="black")
```

```{r proportions, echo=FALSE}
question("Is there a large difference in proportions of those who have Diabetes between Men and Women in our study?",
  answer("Yes, there is a difference", correct=TRUE, message="Yes, there's a difference"),
  answer("No, there is no difference", message="There's a difference between the proportions, take another look."),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


## Relationships: 1 categorical, 1 continuous

Now we're going to investigate the relationship between one variable that is continuous and another variable that is categorical.

### Quick Review of Mathematical Terms

Make sure you understand the following terms before you go on. [Here's a quick review in case you need it.](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-identify-and-calculate-the-mean-median-or-mode-2795785)

- *percentile* 
- *median*
- *mean* 

### Boxplots

When you are trying to understand the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable, you want to use a boxplot.

A [boxplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) allows you to visually compare the distributions by way of a [five number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary) which includes:

- Sample minimum (the smallest value)
- First [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) (*Q<sub>1</sub>*) which is the 25th percentile
- Second quartile (*Q<sub>2</sub>*) also known as the [*median*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median). By definition, this is the middle of the data - 50% of the data is above this value and 50% is below this value.
- Third quartile (*Q<sub>3</sub>*) which is the 75th percentile
- Sample maximum (the largest value)
- Outliers (very large or small values) are represented as dots.

```{r boxplot, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, out.width=500, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
five_number_summary <- iris %>%
  group_by(1) %>%
  summarize(
    `Sample minimum` = min(Sepal.Length),
    `1st quartile (25th percentile)` = quantile(Sepal.Length, 0.25),
    `2nd quartile (median)` = median(Sepal.Length),
    `3rd quartile (75th percentile)` = quantile(Sepal.Length, 0.75),
    `Sample maximum` = max(Sepal.Length)
  ) %>%
  tidyr::gather(Summary, Sepal.Length, -1) %>%
  select(-1)
ggplot(data = iris, aes(y = Sepal.Length, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "gray50") +
  geom_point(data = five_number_summary, size = 9, shape = "←", position = position_nudge(x = 0.025)) +
  geom_label(
    data = five_number_summary,
    aes(label = Summary, hjust = "left"),
    nudge_x = 0.025, size = 5, label.padding = unit(0.5, "lines")
  ) +
  theme_minimal(14) +
  labs(y = "Sepal length (cm)", title = "Box plot", x = NULL) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = "dashed", color = "gray80"),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  )
```
[Example and definition modified from Mikhail Popov](https://github.com/bearloga/wmf-allhands18)

### Understanding Boxplots

Try the different categorical variables out in the data. Is there a difference in medians between the categories? Is that difference meaningful?

```{r echo=FALSE}
selectInput("boxplot1_selection", "Select Categorical Variable", choices = c("Diabetes", "Gender"), selected ="Diabetes")
plotOutput("boxplot1")
```

```{r context="server"}
output$boxplot1 <- renderPlot({
  bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes_string(x=input$boxplot1_selection, y="BMI", fill=input$boxplot1_selection)) +
    geom_boxplot()
})
```

```{r boxplot2, echo=FALSE}
question("Is there a difference between median BMI between those that have diabetes that those who dont?",
         answer("no, there isn't a difference", message=""),
         answer("yes, but the difference is small", message = "You're on the right track. Take a look at the categorization of BMI"),
         answer("yes, and the difference is big", correct = TRUE),
         random_answer_order = TRUE, allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### Boxplots do lose some detail

Take a look at the boxplot and the violin plot side by side. What do you notice?

```{r echo=FALSE}
plotOutput("box_v_violin")
```

```{r context="server"}
output$box_v_violin <- renderPlot({
  boxp <- bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=Diabetes, y=BMI, fill=Diabetes)) +
    geom_boxplot()

  viop <- bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=Diabetes, y=BMI, fill=Diabetes)) +
    geom_violin()

  cowplot::plot_grid(boxp, viop)
})
```

## Relationships: 2 continuous variables

### Scatterplots

Scatterplots show the relationship between two continuous variables. We can add what's called a `fit line` between the two variables. Ideally, we want to see a line that is diagonal as possible. A flat line means there is no association between variables.

In this case, we are showing that knowing the values of one variable (`Weight`) means that you know something about another variable (`BMI`). Anyone know why?

```{r echo=FALSE}
NHANES %>% ggplot(aes(x=Weight,y=BMI)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm",se = FALSE)
```

### Look at the relationship between continuous variables

Now you can try to get a feel for what correlation (linear and non-linear) looks like. Try a few pairs, such as (`BMI` and `Total Cholesterol`), (`BMI` and `Testosterone`), and (`Height`, `Income`).  Before you look at the data, make a guess whether there is a relationship between variables.

Do you see a relationship between these two variables? How strong is the relationship.

```{r}
cont_vars = c("Age","Weight","Height","BMI","Total Cholesterol"= "TotChol","Income"= "HHIncomeMid","Testosterone")

selectInput("select_x", "X-axis", choices = cont_vars,
            selected = "Weight")
selectInput("select_y", "Y-axis", choices = cont_vars,
            selected = "BMI")
plotOutput("scatterPlotCont")
```

```{r context="server"}

                                         "\nSpearman's r = ", round(cor(!!enquo_x, !!enquo_y,use="complete.obs",method="spearman"), digits = 2))
  )

## Relationships: 1 variable versus time

### Time Series

Time series data is everywhere. 

We are often interested in looking at overall trends, or differences in trends.

Many types of clinical data can be represented as time series:

- Lab Information
- Patient Visits
- Nursing Shifts

[Line charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart) are the most common way to visualize [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data, with time **usually** as the horizontal X axis and range of a quantitative variable as the vertical Y axis:
![](images/tsplot-1.png)

[Example modified from wmf-allhands18](https://bearloga.github.io/wmf-allhands18/)

## Spatial Data

Spatial data is rapidly becoming very important, as it allows us to summarize spatial differences.

Below is an interactive map of Portland and Biketown Rentals.

```{r}
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
#library(here)
data("port_bike",package = "dataLiteracyTutorial")

#load(here("data", "port_bike.rda"))

bins <- c(1, 200, 600, 1000, 2000, 5000, Inf)
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = port_bike$num_rentals, bins = bins)

labels <- sprintf(
  "<strong>%s</strong><br/>Number Bike Rentals: %g",
  port_bike$NAME, port_bike$num_rentals
) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)


port_bike %>% leaflet() %>% 
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(num_rentals), weight = 2,
  opacity = 1,
  color = "white",
  dashArray = "3", label = labels,
  fillOpacity = 0.5) %>% addTiles()


```


## Quiz Yourself

### Distributions of annual income

Take a look at the distributions of annual income graph here and compare 1960 to 2016.

https://flowingdata.com/2016/06/28/distributions-of-annual-income/

```{r distributions, echo=FALSE}
question("For healthcare practicioners, what is true about comparing income from 1960 to 2016?",
  answer("The maximum healthcare income is higher for 2016 to 1960", correct=TRUE, message="Yes, the highest paid income is over $200,000 for 2016, and the highest income for 1960 is about $170,000"),
  answer("In general, healthcare salaries have increased", message="Yes. True.", correct=TRUE),
  answer("Healthcare professionals like cats", message="That's nowhere in the graph!"), 
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Quiz Yourself: Looking at Multiple Categories

[The Bechdel Test](http://bechdeltest.com) is a test to determine whether women are represented fairly in movies. 

Look at the graph below. 

![Bechdel Test and Movies](images/hickey-bechdel-11.png)

```{r bechdel}
question("What does the black line in the middle of the graph represent?", 
         answer("It's just for show", message="Take a look at the colors"), 
         answer("Men versus Women", message="take a look at the legend again."),
         answer("The division between those movies that pass the test, and those that fail", correct = TRUE), allow_retry = TRUE)

question("Are there more movies in 2010-2013 that pass the test than those in 1970-1974?", 
         answer("Yes, there are more movies that pass the test",correct=TRUE), answer("No, there are not more movies that pass the test."), allow_retry = TRUE)
```
  
What about the subcategories, such as `Women only talk about men`? Is it easy or hard to see if they are changing with time?

### Did your senatorial vote predict your presidential vote?

Take a look at the scatterplot below. Each dot represents a state polled and their percentage Republican or Democrat. Is there a relationship between knowing the 2012 presidential results and the 2014 presidential results? 

![https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-a-democrat-still-win-the-kentucky-governors-race/](images/kentucky-governor1.png)

```{r vote}
question("For the chart above, were voters presidential preference in 2012 correlated with their vote for senators in 2014?",
         answer("Yes, there's a strong correlation", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Yes, but it's a small correlation", 
                message="Look at the percentages. Is that a big effect or not?"),
         answer("No, there is no correlation.", 
                message="Take a look at the line. Is it on the diagonal?"))
```

## Take Home Points

- 2 categorical variables: barplots
- 1 categorical variable, 1 continuous variable: boxplots
- 2 continuous variables, scatterplots
- 1 variable versus time: lineplot
- Need to understand what the graph is trying to communicate
- Not all charts are good.

## Going beyond: Aesthetics

The following section is optional.

### Aesthetic Properties: Color

Beyond our basic plots, we might want to map different measurements to different visual properties.

For the 2x2 bar plots, we mapped Diabetes to *color*.

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes_small %>% filter(!is.na(BMIstatus)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=BMIstatus, fill=Diabetes)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill", color="black")
```

For scatterplots, we might want to code categorical data as *color* like the example below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=BMI, color=Diabetes)) + geom_point() 
```

### Aesthetic Properties: Shape

Journals used to only allow black and white figures, so color couldn't be used. One alternative is mapping our `Diabetes` Variable to `shape`

```{r echo=FALSE}
bmi_diabetes_small %>% ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=BMI, shape=Diabetes, fill=Diabetes)) + geom_point() 
```


### Waterfall Plots (optional)

Another way to visualize the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable is a waterfall plot. With a waterfall plot, we plot each continuous value as a single bar and sort them increasing value. Each bar is then colored by the categorical variable.

Each of these bars represents a person who smokes (Y/N) and their age. If you are older than 60, are you less likely to smoke?

```{r}

data("Whickham",package = "dataLiteracyTutorial")

Whickham %>% sample_n(size=50) %>% arrange(age) %>% mutate(row_num=1:nrow(.)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=row_num, y=age, fill=smoker)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")


```
